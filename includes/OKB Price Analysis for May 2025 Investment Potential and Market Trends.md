### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Technical Indicators and Market Sentiment  
Short-term technical analysis reveals mixed signals:  
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Neutral at 55  
- **Moving Averages**: 50-day SMA ($56.20) acts as immediate resistance  
- **Trading Volume**: 24-hour volume decreased 4.36% to $6.13M, indicating reduced short-term liquidity

## Future Development and Competitive Landscape  
OKXâ€™s global expansion plans position OKB for growth in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Latin America. Key developments to watch include:
