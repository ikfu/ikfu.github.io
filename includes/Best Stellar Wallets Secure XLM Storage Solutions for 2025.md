### Paper Wallets

Cold storage through paper wallets offers maximum security when properly implemented:

- Physical key generation using [Stellar Account Viewer](https://www.stellar.org/account-viewer/#!/)
- Protection against digital threats
- Requires multiple secure copies for redundancy

However, physical storage introduces risks of damage or theft that must be carefully managed.

## Choosing the Right XLM Wallet

When evaluating storage solutions, consider these critical factors:

1. **Asset Volume**: Hardware wallets for large holdings vs. software wallets for smaller amounts
2. **Transaction Frequency**: Mobile/desktop wallets for regular use vs. cold storage for long-term holdings
3. **Security Needs**: Multi-factor authentication requirements and threat exposure
4. **Technical Proficiency**: User interface complexity and setup requirements

For most investors, a combination approach works best - using hardware wallets for primary storage and mobile/desktop options for daily transactions.
