- **Guaranteed token conversion**: Official confirmation that $ON test tokens will transition to mainnet tokens.  
- **Trust layer contribution**: Participants actively strengthen Monad Chainâ€™s security infrastructure.  

### Why This Matters for Monad Chain  
As the **first DePIN project** on Monad Chain, Orochi Network fills a critical gap in decentralized infrastructure. By incentivizing node participation, it accelerates the chainâ€™s adoption while offering tangible rewards. Early adopters gain a strategic advantage through:  
1. **Higher reward multipliers** for early contributors  
2. **Exclusive access** to future ecosystem integrations  
3. **Network effect amplification** as more projects adopt ONProver  

## How to Participate in the Orochi Airdrop  

### Step-by-Step Guide  
1. **Device Preparation**: Ensure your PC or smartphone meets basic system requirements (4GB RAM minimum).  
2. **Software Installation**: Download the ONProver client from the official repository.  
3. **Wallet Setup**: Connect a compatible wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) for token receipt.  
4. **Node Activation**: Launch the application and begin validating data packets.  

### Optimization Tips  
- Run the node continuously for maximum reward accrual  
- Monitor official channels for upcoming **testnet upgrades**
