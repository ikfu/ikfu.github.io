- Structural breakouts aligning with macroeconomic trends

> **Pro Tip**: Combine technical patterns with fundamental drivers like central bank policies and global economic indicators for enhanced accuracy.

### 2. Position Sizing & Risk Parameters

Effective long-term risk management requires:
- **Minimum 20 USD** distance between entry and profit targets
- **At least 10 USD** buffer between entry and stop-loss levels
- Avoiding micro-profit strategies that amplify drawdown risks

### 3. Advanced Indicator Selection

Critical tools for long-term analysis:

| MA200/MA250       | Major support/resistance levels      | Monthly   |
| DMI               | Directional strength assessment      | Monthly   |
