# How to Buy Degenbot (DBOT): A 3-Step Guide to Purchasing AI Scan Platform Tokens  

## Requirements for Buying DBOT on DEX Platforms  
To purchase Degenbot (DBOT) tokens through decentralized exchanges (DEXs), youâ€™ll need two essential components:  

1. **Digital Wallet**: A compatible crypto wallet like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or OKX Wallet to store and manage your assets.  
2. **Base Cryptocurrency**: Existing holdings of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Solana (SOL) to facilitate the swap.  

> **Tip**: Always ensure your wallet supports the blockchain network where DBOT operates (e.g., Ethereum for ERC-20 tokens).

## What Is a Swap on Decentralized Exchanges?  
A *swap* refers to exchanging one cryptocurrency for another directly on a DEX without intermediaries. This process leverages automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools to execute trades instantly.  

For example, swapping ETH for DBOT allows you to participate in the AI Scan Platform ecosystem, which focuses on blockchain analytics and decentralized finance (DeFi) tools.

### Step 3: Execute the Trade with Caution  
1. Input the amount of base cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH) you want to swap for DBOT.

## Understanding Slippage in Cryptocurrency Trades  
Slippage occurs when the price of an asset changes between the time you initiate a trade and its execution. This is common during high volatility or low liquidity.  

**Example**: If you set a slippage tolerance of 1% and the price moves unfavorably by 1.5%, your trade will fail to protect you from losses. Always monitor market conditions before trading volatile tokens like DBOT.
