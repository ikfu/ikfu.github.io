## Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets  

Cryptocurrency wallets fall into two primary categories: **hot wallets** and **cold wallets**. Understanding their differences is crucial for optimizing security and usability.  

### Hot Wallets: Accessibility vs. Security  

Hot wallets remain connected to the internet, offering convenience for frequent transactions. They are ideal for active traders but inherently riskier due to potential exposure to cyberattacks.  

- **Web Wallets**: Accessible via browsers, these wallets prioritize ease of use but rely on third-party servers.  
- **Mobile Wallets**: Installed as smartphone apps, they provide on-the-go access while implementing security features like biometric authentication.  

### Cold Wallets: Maximum Security for Long-Term Storage  

Cold wallets operate offline, making them immune to online threats. These are preferred for safeguarding large holdings.  

- **Hardware Wallets**: Devices like USB drives store private keys offline. Popular brands include **Trezor** and **Ledger**.  
- **Paper Wallets**: Physical documents containing QR codes and private keys, though vulnerable to physical damage.
