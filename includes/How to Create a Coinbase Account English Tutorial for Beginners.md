## Step 1: Begin the Sign-Up Process

## Step 2: Email Verification  
After submitting your details, Coinbase will send a confirmation link to your inbox. Check your spam folder if the email doesnâ€™t arrive within a few minutes. Click the link to verify your email addressâ€”this step ensures your account remains secure and accessible only to you.

## Step 3: Identity Verification  
Coinbase requires identity verification to comply with regulatory standards and unlock full platform features. Upload a clear photo of your government-issued ID (passport, driverâ€™s license, or national ID card). Ensure all details are legible and the document is valid. Most users complete this step within minutes, though some cases may require additional documentation.

### Common Verification Issues  
- Blurry or low-resolution images  
- Expired IDs  
- Mismatched personal information  

If your verification is declined, review Coinbaseâ€™s [support documentation](https://www.coinbase.com/help) for troubleshooting tips.

## Step 4: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  
Security is critical when managing digital assets. Coinbase recommends enabling **two-factor authentication** via SMS or an authenticator app like Google Authenticator. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring both your password and a time-sensitive code to log in.

## Step 5: Connect a Payment Method  
To buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, link your bank account or credit/debit card. Bank transfers typically incur lower fees but may take 3â€“5 business days to process, while card payments offer instant purchases at slightly higher costs.  

| Payment Method | Pros | Cons |  
|----------------|------|------|  
| Bank Transfer | Low fees | Slower processing |  
| Credit/Debit Card | Instant access | Higher transaction fees |
