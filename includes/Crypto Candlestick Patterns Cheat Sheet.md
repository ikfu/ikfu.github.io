## What Are Crypto Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are visual representations of price action, formed by the open, high, low, and close prices of an asset over a specific period. Each candlestick consists of a body (difference between open and close) and wicks (shadows indicating high and low prices). Traders use these patterns to predict future price behavior, leveraging historical data to inform decisions.

## Types of Candlestick Patterns

Crypto candlestick patterns fall into three categories: **single**, **double**, and **triple** candlestick formations. Each category reveals distinct market dynamics.

### Single Candlestick Patterns
These patterns form within a single candle and often signal potential reversals:
- **Hammer**: A bullish reversal pattern with a long lower wick, indicating buying pressure after a downtrend.
- **Shooting Star**: A bearish reversal pattern with a long upper wick, suggesting selling pressure after an uptrend.
- **Doji**: A neutral pattern where open and close prices are nearly equal, signaling indecision in the market.

### Double Candlestick Patterns
These involve two candles and confirm trend reversals:
- **Bullish Engulfing**: A small bearish candle followed by a larger bullish candle, indicating a shift to bullish momentum.
- **Bearish Engulfing**: The opposite of the bullish engulfing, signaling a bearish takeover.
- **Morning Star/Evening Star**: Three-candle patterns (though technically triple, theyâ€™re often grouped here) that highlight reversals after prolonged trends.

### Triple Candlestick Patterns
These formations require three candles to confirm trends:
- **Three White Soldiers**: Three consecutive bullish candles during a downtrend, signaling a strong reversal.
- **Three Black Crows**: Three bearish candles during an uptrend, indicating a potential downtrend.

## How to Read Crypto Candlestick Charts

Candlestick charts visualize price movements over time. Key elements include:
- **Body color**: Green (bullish) or red (bearish).
- **Wicks**: Represent price extremes.
- **Timeframes**: Daily, hourly, or minute-based candles.

For example, a green candle with a long upper wick during an uptrend might indicate weakening buyer momentum, hinting at a possible reversal.
