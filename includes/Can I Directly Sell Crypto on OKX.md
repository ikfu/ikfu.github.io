## Why Most Crypto Sales Require Conversion  

### **Regulatory and Technical Constraints**:  
- **Policy Compliance**: Many jurisdictions restrict direct crypto-to-fiat exchanges for smaller platforms.  
- **Liquidity Management**: Popular pairs like BTC/USDT have higher liquidity, enabling faster trades.
