# A Data-Driven Review of Decentralized Exchanges in 2019  

## Introduction  
The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has fundamentally transformed Ethereum's economic landscape, positioning decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as critical infrastructure for blockchain ecosystems. This article analyzes the 2019 growth trajectory of DEXs through quantitative metrics and visualizations, focusing on transaction volumes, token performance, and user behavior.

## Methodology and Dataset  

### Analyzed Platforms  
Our study evaluates 20 DEX protocols active throughout 2019, including:  
- **Uniswap**  
- **IDEX**  
- **Kyber Network**  
- **Bancor**  
- **OasisDex**  
- **EtherDelta**  

These platforms represent the most significant contributors to decentralized trading activity. Data excludes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and protocols outside this curated dataset.  

### Measurement Approach  
DEX protocols employ distinct technical architectures, requiring standardized metrics:  
- **Transaction Counts**: Daily trades executed  
- **Trading Volumes**: Measured in ETH equivalents  
- **Token Diversity**: Number of tradable assets  
- **User Activity**: Unique wallet addresses interacting with platforms

## Platform Performance Analysis  

### Daily Transaction Volumes  

IDEX maintained its position as the most actively used DEX throughout 2019, peaking at **7,000 daily transactions** in Q2 before declining to **3,000 transactions/day** by year-end. Uniswap demonstrated exponential growth, surpassing EtherDelta to become the second-largest DEX by transaction count.  

- **Key Observations**:  
  - **Uniswap**: 1,000â€“2,000 daily transactions (Q4)  
  - **Kyber & Bancor**: Similar performance patterns  
  - **Cross-Protocol Arbitrage**: Potential double-counting of trades when liquidity moves between exchanges

#### FAQ: Why Focus on ETH Trading Volumes?  
Most DEXs lack fiat on-ramps, making ETH the primary settlement asset. Using ETH as the base currency ensures consistency across diverse token pairs while avoiding price volatility distortions from external markets.  

---

### Monthly Trading Volumes (ETH Denominated)  

IDEX dominated trading volume, averaging **400,000 ETH/month** in Q1â€“Q3, declining to **200,000 ETH/month** in Q4. Uniswap, Kyber, and Bancor collectively accounted for substantial secondary volumes.  

**Top Performers**:  
| Platform     | Peak Monthly Volume |  
|--------------|---------------------|  
| IDEX         | 400,000 ETH         |  
| Uniswap      | 150,000 ETH         |  
| Kyber        | 120,000 ETH         |

## Token Market Dynamics  

### Dominant Tokens by ETH Trading Volume  

**Stablecoins** emerged as critical assets:  
- **SAI (Old Dai)**: 4.4 million ETH traded (4.6x more than second-place BNT)  
- **Dai (Multi-Collateral)**: Rapid adoption in Q4  
- **USDC & TrueUSD**: Consistent high-volume trading  

#### Chainlink's Surge  
Chainlink (LINK) experienced dramatic growth in Q2â€“Q3, driven by market enthusiasm for its oracle solutions connecting smart contracts to real-world data.

#### FAQ: How Do DEXs Handle Token Swaps?  
Most protocols split direct token swaps into two ETH-based transactions (Token A â†’ ETH â†’ Token B). This methodology simplifies pricing calculations and maintains consistent volume measurement standards.  

---

### Token Diversity Across Platforms  

EtherDelta led in asset availability with **3,190 tradable tokens**, despite lower trading volumes. This highlights its role as a discovery platform for emerging projects.  

**Token Availability Rankings**:  
1. EtherDelta: 3,190 tokens  
2. IDEX: 2,400 tokens  
3. Uniswap: 2,000 tokens

## User Behavior and Network Effects  

### Active Addresses Trends  

- **Uniswap**: Reached **1,300 daily active addresses** in October  
- **OasisDex**: Spike to **900 addresses** in July linked to SAI liquidity mining rewards  
- **Kyber & Uniswap**: Correlated user growth patterns suggest overlapping user bases  

#### Network Overlap Analysis  
Visualization of address usage revealed:  
- **Uniswap & Kyber**: Highest cross-platform user overlap  
- **IDEX**: Largest exclusive user base (38% of total addresses)  
- **Bancor**: Limited overlap due to transaction routing architecture  

#### FAQ: What Causes User Migration Between DEXs?  
Factors include:  
- Protocol fees and slippage rates  
- Token listing availability  
- Interface usability improvements  
- Arbitrage opportunities between platforms

## Key Takeaways and Future Outlook  

2019 marked a pivotal year for DEXs, with Uniswap's automated market maker (AMM) model gaining mainstream traction. While IDEX maintained leadership in transaction volumes, emerging protocols demonstrated rapid adoption through innovative liquidity mechanisms.  

### Emerging Trends:  
1. **Stablecoin Dominance**: SAI/Dai solidified their role as DeFi's backbone  
2. **AMM Growth**: Uniswap's user-friendly design attracted retail and institutional participants  
3. **Cross-Platform Arbitrage**: Increased interconnectedness between DEX ecosystems  

#### FAQ: How Did DEXs Prepare for 2020's DeFi Boom?  
The infrastructure improvements and liquidity pools established in 2019 created a foundation for the explosive growth of yield farming and complex DeFi primitives in 2020.
